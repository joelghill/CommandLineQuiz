"The Great Emu War"

Following World War I, Austrialian and British Solders attempted to settle in Western Austrialia and farm. Life was hard. Especially after 20,000 emus migrated through their land. Due to the land being cultivated and engineered to sustain livestock, the emus thought it was a great place to live. Rather than passing through as they normally would, they decided to stick around.

The Emus devistated the land, and farmers cried out for support. In 1932, official military support was called in. 

The military deployed machine guns and fired over 2,500 rounds of amunition. Only 50 birds were killed. Eventually the military pulled out, as they were unable to combat the large flightless birds with conventional hardware.

At a later date, a second attempt was made to destroy the birds. It was also largely unsuccessful.

Moral of the story: don't mess with emus.
